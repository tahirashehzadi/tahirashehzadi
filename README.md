Hello! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m currently pursuing a PhD degree with the German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI GmbH) and the Technical University of Kaiserslautern, Germany.

    ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on semi-supervised learning and object detection with transformers.
    ðŸŒ± I like to hangout with my friends.
